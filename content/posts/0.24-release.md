Pyodide 0.24 is a major release focused on fine tuning public APIs and
performance improvements. It includes a major rework of the streams APIs to be
faster and more flexible. We also improved the consistence of APIs and made
fixes for many strange edge cases in the foreign function interface. 

## Performance Improvements

Up to this point, we had not devoted much energy to performance improvements so
there was a lot of low hanging fruit.

### Loading performance

We finally added a `packages` argument to `loadPyodide` so that packages can be
downloaded during the Pyodide bootstrap. We also fixed the loading problem where
`pyodide.asm.wasm` is only downloaded after `pyodide.asm.js` is finished loading
which can improve the load time by as much as a second. There is a lot more work
to do in improving load time but both of these changes are significant
improvements.

### Foreign Function Interface performance

Several major bottlenecks were identified: rendering our debug messages for
`PyProxy` use-after-free errors turned out to take a huge amount of run time. we
pregenerate the strings and interning the results, and by only enabling the more
expensive debug support if `pyodide.setDebug(true)` is run first. we also avoid
registering the PyProxy object arguments to a JavaScript function called from
Python if they are destroyed eagerly, since registering and unregistering these
from the garbage collector is expensive.

The other major performance problem was the hiwire map. By changing the data
structures involved we managed to improve the performance of `to_js` by a factor
of 15 on a 10kb json object.

## Streams Rework

The internal implementation of the `pyodide.setStdxxx` APIs were completely
reworked to make them faster and to allow correct handling of keyboard
interrupts and `O_NONBLOCK` / `EAGAIN`. We also added a new way of implementing
standard streams by defining a `read` function for `stdin` or a `write` function
for stdout/stderr. These are the simplest APIs to implement internally, and the
older APIs are implemented in terms of them. In some cases sometimes they are
also the simplest to use, but these cases were previously forced to
inefficiently convert through one of the other options.


## What's next

* Recently clang and Emscripten have added much better support for `externref`.
  Using `externref`s will allow further performance improvements and a
  significant reduction in code size.
* Chrome is going to have origin trials for JavaScript Promise Integration in
  the next few months. Once available in browser engines, the JSPI should solve
  many of our I/O woes. We have already done a lot of work on JSPI support for
  Pyodide and are hoping to include a mature implementation in the next release.
* Cibuildwheel support and a PEP for Emscripten wheels on PyPI support.
* More work on load time and ffi performance.
