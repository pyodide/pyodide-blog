Pyodide 0.23 is a major release focused on updating CPython version to 3.11. It
also brings several new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. This
release includes updates to the Python standard library, deployment and build
system enhancements, and new CLI commands. We also added several new packages
to Pyodide, including fastparquet, pynacl and binary wheels for mypy.

Note that there are several API deprecations; please refer to the
[changelog](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/project/changelog.html#version-0-23-0)
for details.

## Updating to Python 3.11.2

Pyodide 0.23 uses CPython 3.11.2 which in addition to [many feature and
enhancements](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html) is also the first
version to officially support the WebAssembly as a [PEP11 Tier
3](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-3) platform.

For year Pyodide has been distributing a custom build of CPython with many patches.
Now that we can rely on a mostly unmodified CPython, it has become significantly easier
to update CPython versions which is very positive for the
project's sustainability. We are very grateful for the CPython maintainers
[¹](https://blog.pyodide.org/posts/0.22-release/#acknowledgements) who made this possible.

Python 3.11 is estimated to be between 10-60% faster than Python 3.10 for
native execution, and we see comparable improvements with the WebAssembly
runtime on our benchmark suite.

## Load time and size optimizations

Reducing the load time and size of a minimal web page using Pyodide has been a
continuous effort. Several techniques have been implemented aiming to reduce
download size,
 - tests and some standard library modules are unvendored when Pyodide is
   initialized with `loadPyodide({..., fullStdLib=False})`, the default
   currently, and need to be explicitly loaded. In this release we additionally
   unvendored `_pydecimal` and `pydoc_data` modules.
 - Python standard libraries are now vendored in a zipfile,
   using [zipimport](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipimport.html).
   This would make it easier to adjust the contents of this file if needed,
   particularly that `loadPyodide` can now load it from a custom location
   using the `stdLibURL` parameter.

To some extent, however, these optimizations have been offset by the
growth of the Python standard library, and the enabling of additional
functionality over time. 

As can be seen in the following graph, there are size increases for each major
Python version, with an overall, slowly decreasing trend for the download size,

In this release we have also added a py-compiled build for the Python standard
library and packages. This leads to faster initialization times, however
because the size of .pyc files increased in Python 3.11
([cpython#99554](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99554)) the overall
download size is larger:

--------------------------------------------
|        | full | py-compiled |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Download size of Python + sdlib (Brotli compressed) |  5.3 MB |      6.9 MB    | 
| Load + initialization time (Firefox) |  1.3 s |      0.9 s    |
| Load + initialization time (Chrome)  |  0.9 s |      0.5 s    |

*(these benchmarks were done with a 100 MBps connection and browser cache disabled)*

Similarly load time improvements x1.2 - x2.0 were observed for larger packages
such as pandas, sympy or scikit-learn
([pyodide#3269](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/3269))

You can use to py-compiled builds by either setting,
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.23.0/pyc/
```
as the `indexURL` or by appending `?build=pyc` to [the REPL
URL](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/console.html?build=pyc). Pyodide CLI now
also has the command `pyodide py-compile` to py-compile Python wheels to for a
given Python version.

A known limitation of py-compiled builds is that the error traceback no longer
contain code snippets, only the line numbers.

## Javascript API and Foreign Function Interface

The Python / Javascript type conversion API in Pyodide upon which many
downstream projects build, is considered fairly stable and we do not expect
major changes to its API in the future. Nevertheless, this release includes
several improvements of the FFI.

In this release async Python iterators get proxied to async iterable JavaScript
objects. For instance, the following code now works,

```javascript
for await (let x of async_iterator_pyproxy) {
  // ...
}
```
previously it would have failed with a `TypeError`.

Another longstanding issue is that Python does not allow reserved key words as
attributes, which is an issue when calling JavaScript object methods.  For
instance `Array.from` method in JavaScript, cannot be called from Python as it
would produce a `SyntaxError`.To handle this, if an attribute to a `JsProxy`
consists of a Python reserved word followed by one or more underscores, we now
remove a single underscore from the end of the attribute. For instance,
`Array.from_` would access from on the underlying JavaScript object, whereas
`o.from__` accesses the from_ attribute.

Class inheritance of `PyProxy` was also improved,
 - Methods for checking `PyProxy` capabilities (e.g., `supportsHas`,
   `isCallable`) are now deprecated, in favor of using e.g., `instanceof
   pyodide.ffi.PyCallable` instead
 - A `JsProxy` of a JavaScript error object can be directly thrown as Python
   exceptions. Previously Pyodide automatically wrapped them in a `JsException`
   but that is no longer needed – now `JsException` inherits from both JsProxy
   and Exception
 - Checking whether an object is an instance of a PyProxy now only recognizes a
   `PyProxy` generated from the same Python interpreter. This means that creating
   multiple interpreters and importing a `PyProxy` from one into another no
   longer causes a fatal error

There were also some deprecations that you can find in the
[changelog](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/project/changelog.html) and in the
[deprecation
timeline](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/project/deprecation-timeline.html)



## The build system and CLI

In this release we have finished deprecating all `pyodide-build` based
commands, in favor of switching to the top level `pyodide` CLI,
```
$ pyodide --help
 Usage: pyodide [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...                                                
                                                                                           
 A command line interface for Pyodide.                                                     
 Other CLI subcommands are registered via the plugin system by installing Pyodide          
 compatible packages (e.g. pyodide-build).

╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

In particular, `pyodide build-recipes` had many improvements, such as nicer
progress logging with Rich, auto-detection of the number of CPUs for parallel
builds, and the `--no-deps` option to skip dependency resolution.

As to `pyodide build` command for building wheels out-of-tree, it can now
build a list of packages in a `requirements.txt` file via the `-r
<requirements.txt>` parameter. It can also recursively build package
dependencies with the `--build-dependencies` option and allows better build
reproducibility with the `--output-lockfile` parameter.

## Experimental support for SDL2

There has been a long-standing request to add support for graphics applications
to Pyodide. In this release, we have added support for SDL-based packages
relying on the functionality Emscripten provides.
This is still an experimental feature and there are known issues,
but we aim to resolve them in the next release to make it more stable.

If you'd like to try it out, in this release we've added support for Pyxel,
a popular Python game library. You can try running a game made with Pyxel in Pyodide
[here](https://ryanking13.github.io/pyodide-pyxel-test/).

This feature was made possible with the help of the Pyxel maintainers,
so we would like to thank them for their help.
