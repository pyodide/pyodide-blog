Pyodide 0.22 is a major release focused on uppdating CPython version to 3.11, and
including many improvements and bug fixes.

TODO: write a longer summary

We also added several new packages to Pyodide, including fastparquet,
pynacl and mypy (binary wheels).

For a complete list of changes, please see the
[changelog](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/project/changelog.html#version-0-23-0).

## Updating to Python 3.11.2

Pyodide 0.23 now uses CPython 3.11.2 which in addition to [many feature and
enhancements](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html) is also the first
version to officially support the WebAssembly as a [PEP11 Tier
3](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-3) platform.

For year Pyodide has been using a custom build of CPython with many patches.
With patches being untegrated upstream, it is bacame significantly easier
consuming for us to update CPython versions which is very positive for the
project sustainability. We are very greatful for the CPython maintainers
[¹](#acknowledgments) who made this possible.
