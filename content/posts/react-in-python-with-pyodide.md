From web servers to end-to-end Data pipelines, Python has become a ubiquitous tool for building all sorts of programs and software. With powerful built-in libraries and an incredible number of third-party libraries, the Python ecosystem makes it easy to quickly get your project started. In fact, building user interfaces (UIs) is not an exception: [PyQT](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) allows you to create cross-platform desktop applications, whereas libraries like [Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash) allows you to create full-fledged web applications (including the UI) within a single Python script. 

In parallel, the popularity of the JavaScript language for building web UIs resulted in the creation of specialized frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), as well as many associated component libraries like [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and [MUI](https://mui.com/) (formerly known as React Material-UI) to facilitate the creation of consistent and complex UIs for browsers. Moreover, if you wish to extend those components or create your own, you would have to use JavaScript, which is a separate language you will need to learn. 

Fortunately, it turns out that Pyodide has many capabilities that make it possible to directly use React and MUI inside Python, without any JavaScript needed. This is what we will explore in this post.

## Building a React "hello world" example

Let's see how you would build a simple React "hello world" example in Python. The goal will be to create a simple component that will show "Hello world". A component is the most basic unit in React, which can be reused and composed to create more complex UIs; you can read more about it [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html). 

You could use [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to generate a template app. Then, inside the `App.js` file, you would write something like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = (props) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
            <p>This is my first React app.</p>
        </div>
    );
};

export App;
```

Notice that although it is JavaScript, it also uses tags similar to HTML (this is called JSX), and exports the component `App` so it will be rendered later. However, if you wanted to avoid using NPM and having to run a node server, it's possible to do everything within HTML (i.e. inside your `index.html` file). First, you would need to import certain libraries in the head (doing so will avoid having to call `import React from 'react'` later):

```html
<head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
</head>
```

Then, you would add a script in the body where you will create and render your component:
```html
<body>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        // Your JS code goes here
    </script>
</body>
```

If you decide not to use JSX, you can instead use `React.createElement` (we will assign it to a shorthand variable `e`). Furthermore, you will also need to handle the rendering with `ReactDOM.render`. Here's your JS code:

```js
const e = React.createElement;

const App = (props) => {
    return e(
        'div', null,
        e('h1', null, 'Hello World'),
        e('p', null, 'This is my first React app.'),
    );
};

// Create the div to render into.
const domContainer = document.createElement('div');
document.body.appendChild(domContainer);

ReactDOM.render(e(App), domContainer);
```

Putting everything together:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
</head>

<body>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        const e = React.createElement;

        const App = (props) => {
            return e(
                'div', null,
                e('h1', null, 'Hello World'),
                e('p', null, 'This is my first React app.'),
            );
        };

        // Create the div to render into.
        const domContainer = document.createElement('div');
        document.body.appendChild(domContainer);

        ReactDOM.render(e(App), domContainer);
    </script>
</body>

</html>
```

## Rewriting this in Python

Let's now see what this would look like in Python. Let's ignore the JS part for a second; we will use the Pyodide API to proxy the JS call into Python code. If you are not familiar with that, you can check out the [doc page](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/type-conversions.html#proxying-from-javascript-into-python) on the subject. Recall that `js` comes from the Pyodide API and `react` and `react-dom` were loaded with the `<script>` tag in HTML. Now, let's see what the Python code would look like:

```python
import js

e = js.React.createElement

def App(props, children):
    return e(
        'div', None,
        e('h1', None, 'Hello World'),
        e('p', None, 'This is my first React app.'),
    )

# Create a div to contain our component
dom_container = js.document.createElement('div')
js.document.body.appendChild(dom_container)

js.ReactDOM.render(e(App, None), dom_container)
```

This is fairly similar to the JS code above; this is thanks to Pyodide's extensive support for JS -> Python proxying. However, the big difference is that, since we are using Pyodide, it's now possible to use any standard built-in Python library anywhere in the app; we can even use the `pydata` ecosystem (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc.)! 

Of course, we still need to actually load `pyodide.js` from the CDN, and then make the call to our script. The head will need to be updated:

```html
<head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.18.1/full/pyodide.js"></script>
</head>
```

and the Javascript will be replaced with this:
```js
async function main() {
    await loadPyodide({
        indexURL: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.18.1/full/"
    });

    pyodide.runPythonAsync(`
        # Your Python code goes here
    `);
}
main();
```

# Working with React hooks

[React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) are a collection of functions bundled with React that makes it easier to make your app more interactive. For example, a `useState` hook lets you create a variable that can be updated inside your app, as shown in this example from the docs:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"  
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

It's fairly straightforward to do the same thing in Python:

```python
import js
import pyodide

e = js.React.createElement

# helper function
def jsobj(**kwargs):
    return js.Object.fromEntries(pyodide.to_js(kwargs))

def App(props, children):
    count, set_count = js.React.useState(0)

    def handle_click(event):
        set_count(count + 1)

    return e(
        'div', None,
        e('p', None, f"You clicked {count} times"),
        e('button', jsobj(onClick=handle_click), 'Click me'),
    )

# Create a div to contain our component
dom_container = js.document.createElement('div')
js.document.body.appendChild(dom_container)

js.ReactDOM.render(e(App, None), dom_container)
```

> The full demo can be found in `demos/react-in-pyodide/demo-3/` or [on JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/pyodide/pyodide-blog/contents/demos/react-in-pyodide/demo-3/).

You can see that we are adding a `jsobj` helper function to convert the Python `dict` into a JS `Object`. This is because the second argument to `e` is a JS object representing the `props`, hence the need to convert `dict`s to `Object`s.

Note that `useState` is only one possible hook; there are many more. For a full list, see the [React hooks docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html). Note that, since we are calling those hooks through a proxy, it might be possible some capabilities will work out-of-the-box.

## Making components more pythonic

In Python, if you have the following signature:

```python
def func(*args, **kwargs):
    ...
```

Then `args` and `kwargs` will be used as `list` and `dict` respectively, and you can pass in as many arguments as you want. 

Let's say we have a function `pythonify`, which, when called on a React component, will convert it into a Python function with the following signature:
```python
def MyComponent(*children, **props):
    # ...
```

So you can pass in as many children as you want, and any parameter-argument pairs as props. We'd want the object returned to have a method `update(*children, **props)` to add anything you originally omitted; this will modify the object in place. Finally, it'd be nice if we could use `snake_cases` instead of `camelCases`. Let's rewrite the previous `App` function with this more pythonic approach:

```python
# same imports and helper functions as before


def pythonify(component):
    # implementation omitted
    ...

div = pythonify('div')
p = pythonify('p')
button = pythonify('button')


@pythonify
def App(props, children):
    count, set_count = js.React.useState(0)

    def handle_click(event):
        set_count(count + 1)

    return div(
        p(f"You clicked {count} times"),
        button(on_click=handle_click).update('Click me'),
    )

# Create a div to contain our component
dom_container = js.document.createElement('div')
js.document.body.appendChild(dom_container)

js.ReactDOM.render(App(), dom_container)
```

How `pythonify` is implemented is not as important as the fact it is *possible*, and that you can use it to make your components more pythonic. 

> The implementation used in this post is fairly concise (~50 lines) but is convoluted. You can find it in `demos/react-in-pyodide/pythonify.py`. The full example is at `demos/react-in-pyodide/demo-4/`. You can find the [JSFiddle here](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/pyodide/pyodide-blog/contents/demos/react-in-pyodide/demo-4/).


# Incorporating MUI into Python

Being able to use pure React is nice, but most of the time you will need to use a third-party UI library like MUI. If you want to use it inside HTML (as opposed to NPM), all you need is to add a few more `<script>` tags to the head:

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.18.1/full/pyodide.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@material-ui/core@v4.12.3/umd/material-ui.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
    <!-- Fonts to support Material Design -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap" />
    <!-- Icons to support Material Design -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" />
</head>
```

With that, you can use MUI inside your Python app. For example, let's try to construct a more complex version of our previous app. We want:
* A `<p>` that displays the combination `n choose k`
* A MUI `Button` that will increase `n` by 1 every time it is clicked and another that increase `k` by 1 on click
* The second button will be disabled if `k` is equal or greater than `n`

Let's see what our app looks like:

```python
from functools import partial
import math

import js
import pyodide
import js.MaterialUI as mui

# ...

div = pythonify('div')
p = pythonify('p')
Button = pythonify(mui.Button)

@pythonify
def App(props, children):
    k, set_k = js.React.useState(1)
    n, set_n = js.React.useState(1)
    disabled, set_disabled = js.React.useState(True)

    def handle_disable(n, k):
        set_disabled(k >= n)

    def increase_k(event):
        set_k(k + 1)
        set_disabled(k + 1 >= n)

    def increase_n(event):
        set_n(n + 1)
        set_disabled(k >= n + 1)
    
    return div(
        p(f"{n} choose {k} = {math.comb(n, k)}"),
        Button('Increase n').update(
            on_click=increase_n, variant="contained", color="secondary"
        ),
        Button(
            on_click=increase_k, variant="contained", disabled=disabled, color="primary"
        ).update('Increase k'),
    )

# ...
```

> The full demo can be found in `demos/react-in-pyodide/demo-4/` or [on JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/pyodide/pyodide-blog/contents/demos/react-in-pyodide/demo-4/).

Note how we use Python's `math.comb` function to calculate the combination (this function is not available in JS's `math` module). This is only a sneak peek at Python's numerical capabilities; through `numpy` and `scipy`, you can access a significant number of numerical tools that are difficult to find in JS, all without stepping out of the component body.

## Rewriting full fledged MUI apps

With `pythonify` and the proxy system built in Pyodide, you can easily rewrite MUI apps in Python, such as this [official MUI demo](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/v4.x/examples/cdn/index.html). Among else, you can use components you just created inside other components:

```python
# ...
theme = mui.createTheme(dict(...))

@pythonify
def LightBulbIcon(props, children):
    return SvgIcon(...)

@pythonify
def ProTip(props, children):
    classes = use_styles()
    return Typography(...)

@pythonify
def Copyright(props, children):
    return Typography(variant="body2", ...).update(...)

# Let's use everything created above in our App
@pythonify
def App(props, children):
    return Container(...).update(
        div(
            # ...
            ProTip(),
            Copyright(),
            style=dict(...),
        ),
    )
```

## Separating HTML and Python

If you prefer to write your python code inside `.py` files, you can simply move all of the Python code to a separate `main.py` file and fetch it from your HTML file:

```html
<body>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        async function main() {
            let pyodide = await loadPyodide({
                indexURL: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.18.0/full/"
            });

            const script = await fetch("/path/to/main.py");
            const scriptText = await script.text();
            pyodide.runPython(scriptText);
        }

        main();
    </script>
</body>
```

Note that the absolute path needs to be specified, and will differ based on your provider. [This repo](https://github.com/xhlulu/material-ui-in-pyodide) shows you how it works on Github Pages. In general, JS will try to look for `yourwebsite.com/path/to/main.py` and will be able to fetch it if a text file exists at that location.


## Conclusion

In summary, this post covered how to use Python to implement fundamental React concepts (such as hooks) and simple MUI components, and proposed the use of a `pythonify` function to make the component creation process feel more natural. 

Moving forward, it will be interesting to see how we can leverage Pyodide to build React UIs using the thousands of React libraries available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:react) along with pure Python libraries on PyPi. Rather than replacing other Python UI frameworks, React+Pyodide would instead complement them. For example, whereas Dash allows you to write Python code on the server side (e.g. to process GBs of data and running GPU computations), it still requires you to use JS to create [custom components](https://github.com/plotly/dash-component-boilerplate) and [client-side callbacks](https://dash.plotly.com/clientside-callbacks). To fill this gap, React+Pyodide would allow you to create sophisticated UIs on the client side (e.g. to render a large number of components) without leaving Python, so community effort to connect those two frameworks could allow a full end-to-end workflow for building `pydata` apps in Python on both server and client-side.
