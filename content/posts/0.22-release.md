Pyodide 0.22 is a major release focused on improving the
foreign function interface (FFI) between Python and JavaScript.
The goal of Pyodide is to make it easy to use JavaScript objects
in Python as if they were native Python objects, and vice versa.
In this release, we have made several improvements to the FFI
to achieve this goal.

We have also separated micropip, the lightweight package manager used in Pyodide,
into a standalone repository called [`micropip`](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip)
and released it as a Python package. We also separated the matplotlib
HTML backend into a package called [`matplotlib-pyodide`](https://github.com/pyodide/matplotlib-pyodide).

As an experimental feature, we have added support for mounting a local filesystem
into the Pyodide filesystem using the
[File System Access API](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/file-system-access/).
This feature is currently only available in Chrome.

Additionally, we have added 16 new packages to Pyodide, including geopandas and fiona,
which have been a long-standing request from the geospatial community.

For a complete list of changes, please see the
[changelog](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/project/changelog.html#version-0-22-0).

## Improvements in the Pyodide FFI

In Pyodide 0.22.0 we have made several improvements to the Pyodide Foreign Function
Interface (FFI). It is now possible to use `reverse`, `__reversed__`, `count`, `index`,
`append`, and `pop` on JavaScript arrays from Python. It is also possible to use
`keys`, `items`, `values`, `get`, `pop`, `setdefault`, `popitem`, `update`, and `clear`
on JavaScript map-like objects from Python.

TODO: PyProxy?
TODO: add example?

## Separating packages in Pyodide

From the previous 0.21.0 release, we are trying to separate packages
that are used in Pyodide into standalone repositories.
We now have the following packages available as standalone repositories:

- [pytest-pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/pytest-pyodide):
a pytest plugin for testing dedicated Pyodide applications.
- [micropip](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip):
a lightweight package manager for Pyodide and Python in the browser.
- [matplotlib-pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/matplotlib-pyodide):
a matplotlib HTML backend.

By separating these packages, we hope to facilitate their development
and make it easier for the Python-in-the-browser community to use and improve them.
