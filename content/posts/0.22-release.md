Pyodide 0.22 is a major release focused on improving the foreign function
interface (FFI) between Python and JavaScript. The goal of Pyodide is to make it
easy to use JavaScript objects in Python as if they were native Python objects,
and vice versa. In this release, we have made several improvements to the FFI to
achieve this goal.

We have also separated micropip, the lightweight package manager used in
Pyodide, into a standalone repository called
[`micropip`](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip) and released it as a Python
package. We also separated the matplotlib HTML backend into a package called
[`matplotlib-pyodide`](https://github.com/pyodide/matplotlib-pyodide).

As an experimental feature, we have added support for mounting a local filesystem
into the Pyodide filesystem using the
[File System Access API](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/file-system-access/).
This feature is currently only available in Chrome.

Additionally, we have added 16 new packages to Pyodide, including geopandas and fiona,
which have been a long-standing request from the geospatial community.

For a complete list of changes, please see the
[changelog](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/project/changelog.html#version-0-22-0).

## Improvements in the Pyodide FFI

In Pyodide 0.22.0 we have made several improvements to the Pyodide Foreign Function
Interface (FFI). It is now possible to use `reverse`, `__reversed__`, `count`, `index`,
`append`, and `pop` on JavaScript arrays from Python. It is also possible to use
`keys`, `items`, `values`, `get`, `pop`, `setdefault`, `popitem`, `update`, and `clear`
on JavaScript map-like objects from Python.

TODO: PyProxy?
TODO: add example?

## Unvendoring Pyodide-specific packages

Pyodide includes a few pure Python packages written specifically for use with
Pyodide. We have unvendored these packages into standalone repositories.

The following packages have been unvendored:

- [pytest-pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/pytest-pyodide):
a pytest plugin for testing dedicated Pyodide applications.
- [micropip](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip):
a lightweight package manager for Pyodide and Python in the browser.
- [matplotlib-pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/matplotlib-pyodide):
a matplotlib HTML backend.

By separating these packages from the main Pyodide repository, we hope to
facilitate their development and make it easier for the Python-in-the-browser
community to use and improve them. They depend on the Pyodide ffi modules so for
now it is still difficult to use them separate from Pyodide. In the future we
hope to also unvendor the foreign function interface so that other Emscripten
builds of CPython can use it.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to everyone who contributed code to this release and all users who
reported issues and provided feedback. Thanks to the Jupyterlite and PyScript
developers for their feedback and contributions. Thanks to the Emscripten team
for their helpful and responsive support. Thanks to Brett Cannon and Christian
Heimes for continuing to work on improving core Python support for the
Emscripten platform.  We would also like to thank the entire
Python-in-the-browser community for experimentation and discussion which have
helped determine the direction both of Pyodide and the broader
Python-in-the-browser project.
