We are pleased to announce the Pyodide v0.29.0 release. This is a small feature
release. 

## `toJs()` and `to_js()` now convert dictionaries to `Object` instead of `Map` by default

After much feedback from users, we changed `toJs()` and `to_js()` to convert
dictionaries to Object by default. To opt into the old behavior, you can pass
`toJsLiteralMap: true` to `loadPyodide()`. This will be removed in a future
release.

This was the main change motivating the feature release.

## Open Source Contribution Academy Partnership

From July to October 2025, Pyodide participated in the Open Source Contribution
Academy. This program, funded by the South Korean government, selects and
supports individuals interested in contributing to open source project such as
Pyodide.

Pyodide selected over 15 participants for the program. These contributors made
significant advancements to Pyodide in various areas, including bug fixes,
documentation enhancements, and new features.

Here are a few notable contributions from the participants:

### Introducing the New `pyxhr` Module

We've added a new module, `pyodide.http.pyxhr`, which provides a synchronous
HTTP client built on `XMLHttpRequest`. This is specifically designed for browser
environments where traditional synchronous HTTP libraries are unavailable.

Previously, Pyodide offered `pyodide.http.pyfetch` for asynchronous requests
using the browser's native Fetch API. However, integrating an asynchronous API
into existing synchronous code patterns was often complicated.

The new `pyxhr` module solves this by offering a synchronous client with a
requests-like API for making straightforward HTTP requests.

A word of caution: Making synchronous HTTP requests on the main thread will
block the UI thread. So please use `pyxhr` in a cautious manner. It is most
useful for simple requests that don't require the complexity of asynchronous
programming.

**Example Usage:**

```python
from pyodide.http import pyxhr
response = pyxhr.get("[https://api.example.com/data](https://api.example.com/data)")
data = response.json()
```

### Event Loop Compatibility Improvements

Pyodide uses a custom event loop based on the browser's event loop. It
previously only partially supported CPython's `BaseEventLoop` interface, which
led to issues when using `asyncio`. For example, standard APIs like `set_debug`
and `shutdown_asyncgens` were not implemented and raised `NotImplementedError`,
which was unexpected for users.

We have significantly improved compatibility with the standard event loop APIs
during this period. The methods mentioned above are now properly implemented.
Additionally, other APIs that remain unsupported now provide a more meaningful
and helpful error message to users.

### Standardized Typing for Emscripten Types

Pyodide is built on Emscripten, and some of its public APIs expose
Emscripten-specific types and objects. Previously, the type definitions for
these objects were managed within Pyodide's own type system, leading to
inconsistencies with Emscripten's official typing (see [issue
\#5546](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/5546)). This caused challenges
for developers trying to use these objects.

To resolve this, we have adopted and standardized Emscripten types based on
definitions from
[DefinitelyTyped](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/emscripten). We also
contributed extensively to DefinitelyTyped to enhance the quality of these
Emscripten type definitions. This work ensures a consistent type system for
other projects using Pyodide or Emscripten types.

### SIMD Support Exploration

We've begun exploring the integration of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple
Data) operations in Pyodide, leveraging the WebAssembly SIMD feature. Currently,
we have only tested SIMD operations with basic test packages. Our goal is to
enable SIMD support in key numerical computing packages like numpy and scipy in
the near future, which should lead to significant performance gains.

### New Xterm.js-Based Pyodide Console

The Pyodide Web Console, which provides a web REPL example in our documentation,
previously relied on the jQuery Terminal library. While effective for a long
time, we recently received reports that jQuery Terminal was causing issues on
some mobile browsers.

To address this, we have implemented a new Pyodide Web Console using the
Xterm.js library for the terminal emulator. This new console supports all the
features of the old one while providing a better, more consistent terminal
experience on mobile browsers.

You can currently try the new console
[here](https://pyodide.org/en/latest/console-v2.html). We plan to replace the
old console with this new version in the near future.
