We would like to announce that Pyodide is now member of the [Open Source
Collective (OSC)](https://www.oscollective.org/), which will act as project's
fiscal host.

The Pyodide project, that compiles Python and the scientific stack to
WebAssembly, was created in 2018 by Michael
Droettboom at Mozilla as part of the [Iodide
project](https://github.com/iodide-project/iodide). Later in 2021 [Pyodide
become an indepenent open-source
project](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/04/pyodide-spin-out-and-0-17-release/),
and the current annoucement completes this transition. By selecting OSC as our
fiscal host, Pyodide will be able to recieve donnations and accepts
sponsorships which would help long term project sustainability.

We are now accepting donations at:
 - the OSC project page: [opencollective.com/pyodide](https://opencollective.com/pyodide)
 - or via Github Sponsors: [github.com/sponsors/pyodide](https://github.com/sponsors/pyodide)

Funds will be mostly spent to organize in-person developer sprints.
