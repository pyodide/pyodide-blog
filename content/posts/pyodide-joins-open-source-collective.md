We would like to announce that Pyodide is now a member of the [Open Source
Collective (OSC)](https://www.oscollective.org/), which will act as the project's
fiscal host.

The Pyodide project compiles Python and the scientific stack to WebAssembly using Emscripten.
Pyodide was created in 2018 by Michael
Droettboom at Mozilla as part of the [Iodide
project](https://github.com/iodide-project/iodide). Later in 2021 [Pyodide
became an independent open-source
project](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/04/pyodide-spin-out-and-0-17-release/),
and the current announcement completes this transition.

Pyodide is now
able to receive donations and accept sponsorships though Open Source Collective, which should help
long term project sustainability. We have looked at a few non-profit umbrella
organizations before making this choice, and we quite like the financial
transparency and ease of setup offered by OSC. In addition, since Pyodide use
cases are wider than scientific computing, we felt that a non-specialized
fiscal host would be best.

We are now accepting donations at the OSC project page: [opencollective.com/pyodide](https://opencollective.com/pyodide)
Funds will be mostly spent to organize in-person developer sprints.

On a different subject, Pyodide now has a blog, where you are reading this
post. In the future we will share here project announcement, examples of real
world use cases for Pyodide, as well as more technical posts about how Pyodide
works. We also accept guest posts on
[GitHub](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-blog).
