Pyodide 0.19 is a major release focused on improving the build system, updating
core scientific dependencies, and improving the workflow for loading Python
code.

### Removal of function pointer cast emulation

The Python C extensions occasionally use function points casts, which is an
undefined behavior in C specification. However, in practice, all native C
compilers produce code that works fine.  This is not the case with Emscripten
when building for WebAssembly, which will fails on function pointer casts.  As
a workaround we have been using Emscripten's `-s
EMULATE_FUNCTION_POINTER_CASTS` flag, which emits code to emulate function
pointer casts at runtime. This has however a significant performance and size
overhead.  

In version 0.19 we were able to remove the function cast emulation by using
JavaScript method call trampolines in a few places where the function pointer
casts are happening.
This allowed to increase the maximum supported recursion depth to the
default value of 1000, decrease the compiled code size by ~25% and make Python
run faster by 10 to 20%.  For more details about this work, see our post on
[Function Pointer Cast Handling in
Pyodide](https://blog.pyodide.org/posts/function-pointer-cast-handling/).

### SciPy Upgrade

The initial version of SciPy added to Pyodide was 0.17.1 from 2016. Since then
we had major difficulties in updating it, due SciPy being quite large,
difficult to build, and due to the use of Fortran which has no reliable
compiler supporting WebAssembly. The inability to update SciPy, in turn
prevented the update of other scientific Python packages, such as scikit-learn,
scikit-image and statsmodels.

In this version, after a lot of work, SciPy was finally updated in
[pyodide/pyodide#2065](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/2065) as well packages that depended
on it.  There are still known issues with SciPy packaged in Pyodide, and components don't work. However,
this update is a major milestone in getting us closer to the development
version of SciPy and allowing to contribute fixes upstream. This also allowed 

### Type conversions improvements and a new JS calling convention

We hope to encourage people to develop their Python code for use in Pyodide like
normal Python packages and to call into their Python packages directly from
JavaScript. Using `pyodide.runPython` directly is like using `eval`: it works
alright in some cases, but usually there are better alternatives.

We added polish to core features based on user feedback, including bugfixes and
convenience improvements.

We added several functions that allow conversion of JavaScript buffers to
various Python objects with as few copies as possible, which are useful
internally to Pyodide and should also help applications processing data to do
faster conversions in certain cases. 

We also changed the calling convention for invoking a JavaScript function from Python
so that in some cases no special care needs to be taken to call JavaScript
``
functions from Python without leaking Python objects. We also made it much
easier to call asynchronous Python functions from JavaScript.

##  pyfetch, and unpack_archive

We added a new `pyfetch` API to make fetch requests from Python and convert the
response directly into various Python types. 

### Micropip improvements

The observability of micropip was improved with better error messages, an easier
way to debug missing wheels, and a way to list out what packages micropip has
installed.

We thank all contributors to this release as well as users who provided feedback and reported issues.
