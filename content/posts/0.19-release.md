Pyodide version 0.19.0 has fewer changes to the core Pyodide runtime than
previous versions. We focused on improving the build system and the systems for
loading Python code. There is a lot more work to be done in this area.

We hope to encourage people to develop their Python code for use in Pyodide like
normal Python packages and to call into their Python packages directly from
Javascript. Using `pyodide.runPython` directly is like using `eval`: it works
alright in some cases, but usually there are better alternatives.

The core type conversions system and Pyodide runtime remained much more stable
than in the last few releases. We added polish to core features based on user
feedback, including bugfixes and convenience improvements. Hopefully as
we make fewer changes to core systems we will see fewer new problems come up.

We added several functions that allow conversion of Javascript buffers to
various Python objects with as few copies as possible, which are useful
internally to Pyoide and should also help applications processing data to do
faster conversions in certain cases. 

We added a new `pyfetch` API to make fetch requests from Python and convert the
response directly into various Python types. 

### Function pointer cast removal

We removed the `-s EMULATE_FUNCTION_POINTER_CASTS` flag, which yielded large
benefits in speed, stack usage, and code size.

### Scipy Upgrade
We upgraded SciPy to 1.7.3. ...

### pyfetch & unpack_archive

### pyodide-build much easier to use

### Micropip improvements

The observability of micropip was improved with better error messages, an easier
way to debug missing wheels, and a way to list out what packages micropip has
installed.

### New Js Calling convention

We changed the calling convention for invoking a Javascript function from Python
so that in some cases no special care needs to be taken to call Javascript
functions from Python without leaking Python objects. We also made it much
easier to call asynchronous Python functions from Javascript.
