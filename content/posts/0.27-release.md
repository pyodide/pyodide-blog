Pyodide v0.27.0 is out. This release focuses on improving the long-term stability of Pyodide.

# Welcome Agriya Khetarpal to the Pyodide team

Agriya Khetarpal has joined Pyodide as the new maintainer.
Agriya has been active in the Scientific Python area and is a contributor of Numpy, Scipy, and scikit-learn.
He has already contributed significantly to strengthening Pyodide support in various Scientific Python packages.

## Build System Improvements

### Decoupling pyodide-build from Pyodide runtime

pyodide-build is a tool that builds Python packages for the WASM environment to run in Pyodide.
Previously, the version of pyodide-build was strongly tied to the version of Pyodide,
meaning that if you wanted to build a package against a specific version of Pyodide, you had to use a corresponding version of pyodide-build.
The problem with this approach was that even if we improved the build system, you would have to wait a few months after Pyodide was released to use it.

In this release, we have separated pyodide-build from the Pyodide runtime.
This allows us to develop and release pyodide-build independently of Pyodide more quickly,
and you can apply these improvements to your packages sooner.

pyodide-build is now developed in [pyodide/pyodide-build](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build),
and you can install it with the command `pip install pyodide-build`.

### New Packages Support

This release includes about a dozen new packages, most notably PyArrow and DuckDB, which people have long requested.
What's unique about these new packages is that they are not being built from the Pyodide repository,
but are being built out-of-tree by the package maintainers using pyodide-build.

Previously, Pyodide has built all packages directly from within the repository.
This had been a significant limitation on long-term scalability,
especially for large libraries like PyArrow, which take tens of minutes or more to build.
Now, these packages are built in a separate repository and managed by the package maintainers.
We expect this change will improve package stability and pave the way for more packages to be added to Pyodide in the long run.
