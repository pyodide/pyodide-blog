Pyodide v0.27.0 is out. This release focuses on improving the long-term stability of Pyodide.

# Welcome Agriya Khetarpal to the Pyodide team

Agriya Khetarpal has joined Pyodide as the new maintainer.
Agriya has been active in the Scientific Python area and is a contributor of NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn.
He has already contributed significantly to strengthening Pyodide support in various Scientific Python packages.

# Pyodide 0.27 Release

## Build System Improvements

### Decoupling `pyodide-build` from Pyodide runtime

`pyodide-build` is a tool that builds Python packages for the WASM environment to
run in Pyodide. Previously, the version of `pyodide-build` was strongly tied to
the version of Pyodide, meaning that if you wanted to build a package against a
specific version of Pyodide, you had to use a corresponding version of
`pyodide-build`. The problem with this approach was that even if we improved the
build system, you would have to wait a few months after Pyodide was released to
use it.

In this release, we have separated `pyodide-build` from the Pyodide runtime.
This allows us to develop and release `pyodide-build` independently of Pyodide more quickly,
and you can apply these improvements to your packages sooner.

pyodide-build is now developed in [pyodide/pyodide-build](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build),
and you can install it with the command `pip install pyodide-build`.

Recent versions of `pyodide-build` work with Pyodide 0.26 and higher. This means you can use, say,
`pyodide-build` version 0.29.2, to set up an older Pyodide 0.26.4 cross-build environment:

```bash
pip install pyodide-build==0.29.2
pyodide xbuildenv install 0.26.4
pyodide build <...>
```

In case we decide to drop compatibility for a particular version of Pyodide, we shall mark it as such in
the [cross-build environments metadata file](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/blob/main/pyodide-cross-build-environments.json).

### Wheels for new packages

This release includes about a dozen new packages, most notably PyArrow, Polars,
and DuckDB, which people have long requested. What's unique about these new
packages is that they are not being built from the Pyodide repository, but are
being built out-of-tree by the package maintainers using `pyodide-build` or
other tools. This is a significant milestone for Pyodide, as it demonstrates
that the Pyodide build system is mature enough to be used by package maintainers
to build their packages for Pyodide.

We hope that the inclusion of these packages will make Pyodide more useful for
high-performance data science and data engineering tasks, especially for those
who would appreciate leveraging the power of in-browser computation with a
familiar Python interface.

Previously, Pyodide has built all packages directly from within the repository.
This had been a significant limitation on long-term scalability,
especially for large libraries like PyArrow, which take tens of minutes or more
to build. Now, these packages are built in a separate repository and managed by
the package maintainers.
We expect this change will improve package stability and [pave the
way](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/4918) for more packages to be
added to Pyodide in the long run.

### Update to NumPy 2.0

We have updated NumPy to version 2.0.2. This is a significant update that
included rebuilding all packages that depend on NumPy at build time to
account for NumPy's C-API ABI breakage. It should be noted that this update
is not a breaking change for users of Pyodide, but it is a breaking change for
package maintainers who need to rebuild against the new NumPy version.

Please see https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/26191 for notes around the
ecosystem impact and the earliest versions for specific packages that declared
their compatibility with NumPy v2.

## Performance improvements to foreign function interface

We've long prioritized making the foreign function comprehensive and correct
over making it fast. At this point we have implemented even quite niche features
and we don't get many bug reports. However, for certain use cases the foreign
function interface is just too slow, for instance for canvas rendering. It is
possible to avoid making many ffi calls by constructing a data structure
representing the set of desired actions and writing a helper JavaScript function
to batch many canvas calls in one call out to JavaScript. But it would be nice
if the ffi were fast enough to avoid the need for this.

The first improvement we made was to `getattr` on a `JsProxy`. Each `JsProxy`
has a Python dictionary in addition to the JavaScript object that it holds. When
someone accesses an attribute on the `JsProxy` we have to first look it up on
the dictionary. If we don't find the attribute on the dictionary, we then look
up the attribute on the JavaScript object. We were using code roughly like this:
```C
// try lookup on jsproxy itself
PyObject* result = PyObject_GenericGetAttr(jsproxy, attr);
if (result != NULL || !PyErr_ExceptionMatches(PyExc_AttributeError)) {
    // If we got something return it. If we raised an error that isn't an attribute error,
    // propagate error.
    return result;
}
// okay lookup failed, that was expected. Clear error and try doing a js lookup.
PyErr_Clear();
jsresult = JsProxy_GetAttr_js(JsProxy_GetJsObject(jsproxy), attr);
```
On the expected codepath, `PyObject_GenericGetAttr` sets an `AttributeError` and
then we clear it and keep going. It turned out that in a successful lookup,
between 43% and 76% of the execution time was spent formatting the error message
for the attribute error. We replaced the call to `PyObject_GenericGetAttr` with
the private API `_PyObject_GenericGetAttrWithDict` which basically behaves the
same as `PyObject_GenericGetAttr` but if the object isn't found, instead of
formatting an `AttributeError` it simply returns `NULL`. If there is any other
sort of error, the error flag is still set. This avoids wasting time formatting
an error message that we are planning to throw away.

The second improvement we made was to optimize away temporary bound methods.
Python code like
```py
a.f()
```
means first look up `a.f` and then call the result, which is translated into
bytecode like:
```
LOAD a
LOAD_ATTR f
CALL
```
The function `a.f` receives `a` as the first `self` argument, so it needs to be
a special bound method object that knows about the `self` argument. However, we
only use this object once to call it and then we are going to throw it away. We
can avoid allocating and destroying an object when we call a method by calling
`type(a).f(a)`. The `LOAD_ATTR` opcode has a special argument that indicates
that the next opcode is going to be `CALL` and in that case calls a method named
`_PyObject_GetMethod` instead of the typical `PyObject_GetAttr` to perform the
attribute lookup. We patched `_PyObject_GetMethod` to have special handling for
`JsProxy` objects so that we could optimize away the temporary for JS objects too.

### A potential future performance improvement

In the case of lookup on a `JsProxy`, there are other bytecode patterns where we
could optimize away temporaries. For instance, if `a` is a `JsProxy` for the
JavaScript object `{ x: { y: 2 } }` then `a.x.y` creates a temporary `JsProxy`
pointing to `{ y: 2 }` and then looks up `y` on the temporary and returns `2`.
The bytecode looks like:
```
LOAD a
LOAD_ATTR x
LOAD_ATTR y
```
If we know that we were going to use the result of the first `LOAD_ATTR x`
immediately, we could avoid creating the temporary. Unfortunately, unlike the
method call example, native Python code doesn't create a temporary here so
optimizing this would involve more invasive patches to the interpreter than
removing the temporary bound methods.

## Work in Progress / Roadmap

For Pyodide 0.28, we hope to unvendor the package recipes from the main Pyodide
repository. The package index will gain a separate release process from the
Pyodide runtime itself. This should have several significant benefits:

* It will reduce CI usage due to rebuilding packages less often.
* People who add a package will not have to wait as long until their package is
  included in our index.

We are working on adding Emscripten back as a tier 3 target for Python. As a
part of this work, we have recently upstreamed a large number of fixes to the
Emscripten file system. This will make a lot of obscure h
