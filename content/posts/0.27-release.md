# Pyodide 0.27 Release

## Decoupling pyodide-build from Pyodide runtime

In this release we have separated pyodide-build, which is used to build packages for Pyodide, from the Pyodide runtime.
Previously, in order to build a package for a specific Pyodide version,
you had to use the same version of pyodide-build, but now you can easily use the latest version of pyodide-build to build a package for a specific version of Pyodide....

DuckDB, PyArrow
