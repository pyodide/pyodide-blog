Pyodide v0.27.0 is out. This release focuses on improving the long-term stability of Pyodide.

# Welcome Agriya Khetarpal to the Pyodide team

Agriya Khetarpal has joined Pyodide as the new maintainer.
Agriya has been active in the Scientific Python area and is a contributor of Numpy, Scipy, and scikit-learn.
He has already contributed significantly to strengthening Pyodide support in various Scientific Python packages.

# Pyodide 0.27 Release

## Build System Improvements

### Decoupling pyodide-build from Pyodide runtime

pyodide-build is a tool that builds Python packages for the WASM environment to run in Pyodide.
Previously, the version of pyodide-build was strongly tied to the version of Pyodide,
meaning that if you wanted to build a package against a specific version of Pyodide, you had to use a corresponding version of pyodide-build.
The problem with this approach was that even if we improved the build system, you would have to wait a few months after Pyodide was released to use it.

In this release, we have separated pyodide-build from the Pyodide runtime.
This allows us to develop and release pyodide-build independently of Pyodide more quickly,
and you can apply these improvements to your packages sooner.

pyodide-build is now developed in [pyodide/pyodide-build](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build),
and you can install it with the command `pip install pyodide-build`.

### New Packages Support

This release includes about a dozen new packages, most notably PyArrow and DuckDB, which people have long requested.
What's unique about these new packages is that they are not being built from the Pyodide repository,
but are being built out-of-tree by the package maintainers using pyodide-build.

Previously, Pyodide has built all packages directly from within the repository.
This had been a significant limitation on long-term scalability,
especially for large libraries like PyArrow, which take tens of minutes or more to build.
Now, these packages are built in a separate repository and managed by the package maintainers.
We expect this change will improve package stability and [pave the way](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/4918) for more packages to be added to Pyodide in the long run.

## Performance improvements to foreign function interface

We've long prioritized making the foreign function comprehensive and correct
over making it fast. At this point we have implemented even quite niche features
and we don't get many bug reports. However, for certain use cases the foreign
function interface is just too slow, for instance for canvas rendering. It is
possible to avoid making many ffi calls by constructing a data structure
representing the set of desired actions and writing a helper JavaScript function
to batch many canvas calls in one call out to JavaScript. But it would be nice
if the ffi were fast enough to avoid the need for this.

The first improvement we made was to `getattr` on a `JsProxy`. Each `JsProxy`
has a Python dictionary in addition to the JavaScript object that it holds. When
someone accesses an attribute on the `JsProxy` we have to first look it up on
the dictionary. If we don't find the attribute on the dictionary, we then look
up the attribute on the JavaScript object. We were using code roughly like this:
```C
// try lookup on jsproxy itself
PyObject* result = PyObject_GenericGetAttr(jsproxy, attr);
if (result != NULL || !PyErr_ExceptionMatches(PyExc_AttributeError)) {
    // If we got something return it. If we raised an error that isn't an attribute error,
    // propagate error.
    return result;
}
// okay lookup failed, that was expected. Clear error and try doing a js lookup.
PyErr_Clear();
jsresult = JsProxy_GetAttr_js(JsProxy_GetJsObject(jsproxy), attr);
```
On the expected codepath, `PyObject_GenericGetAttr` sets an `AttributeError` and
then we clear it and keep going. It turned out that in a successful lookup,
between 43% and 76% of the execution time was spent formatting the error message
for the attribute error. We replaced the call to `PyObject_GenericGetAttr` with
the private API `_PyObject_GenericGetAttrWithDict` which basically behaves the
same as `PyObject_GenericGetAttr` but if the object isn't found, instead of
formatting an `AttributeError` it simply returns `NULL`. If there is any other
sort of error, the error flag is still set. This avoids wasting time formatting
an error message that we are planning to throw away.

The second improvement we made was to optimize away temporary bound methods.
Python code like
```py
a.f()
```
means first look up `a.f` and then call the result, which is translated into
bytecode like:
```
LOAD a
LOAD_ATTR f
CALL
```
The function `a.f` receives `a` as the first `self` argument, so it needs to be
a special bound method object that knows about the `self` argument. However, we
only use this object once to call it and then we are going to throw it away. We
can avoid allocating and destroying an object when we call a method by calling
`type(a).f(a)`. The `LOAD_ATTR` opcode has a special argument that indicates
that the next opcode is going to be `CALL` and in that case calls a method named
`_PyObject_GetMethod` instead of the typical `PyObject_GetAttr` to perform the
attribute lookup. We patched `_PyObject_GetMethod` to have special handling for
`JsProxy` objects so that we could optimize away the temporary for JS objects too.

### A potential future performance improvement

In the case of lookup on a `JsProxy`, there are other bytecode patterns where we
could optimize away temporaries. For instance, if `a` is a `JsProxy` for the
JavaScript object `{ x: { y: 2 } }` then `a.x.y` creates a temporary `JsProxy`
pointing to `{ y: 2 }` and then looks up `y` on the temporary and returns `2`.
The bytecode looks like:
```
LOAD a
LOAD_ATTR x
LOAD_ATTR y
```
If we know that we were going to use the result of the first `LOAD_ATTR x`
immediately, we could avoid creating the temporary. Unfortunately, unlike the
method call example, native Python code doesn't create a temporary here so
optimizing this would involve more invasive patches to the interpreter than
removing the temporary bound methods.
