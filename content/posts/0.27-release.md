Pyodide v0.27.0 is out. This release was focused on improving the long-term
stability of Pyodide.

## Welcome Agriya Khetarpal to the Pyodide team

Agriya Khetarpal has joined as a new maintainer. Agriya has been active in the
Scientific Python area and is a contributor to NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn.
He has already significantly strengthened Pyodide's support for various
Scientific Python packages.

## Build System Improvements

### Decoupling `pyodide-build` from Pyodide runtime

`pyodide-build` is a tool that builds Python packages to run in Pyodide.
Previously, the version of `pyodide-build` was strongly coupled to the version
of Pyodide, meaning that if you wanted to build a package against a specific
version of Pyodide, you had to use the corresponding version of `pyodide-build`.
The problem with this approach was that even if we improved the build system,
downstream users would have to wait for the next Pyodide release to use it.

In this release, we have separated `pyodide-build` from the Pyodide runtime.
This allows us to develop and release `pyodide-build` independently of Pyodide.
`pyodide-build` is now developed in [pyodide/pyodide-build](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build).
You can install it with `pip install pyodide-build`.

Recent versions of `pyodide-build` work with Pyodide 0.26 and higher. For
example, you can use `pyodide-build` version 0.29.2 to build packages for use
with Pyodide 0.26.4:

```bash
pip install pyodide-build==0.29.2
pyodide xbuildenv install 0.26.4
pyodide build <...>
```

### Wheels for new packages

This release includes about twenty new packages, most notably popular data
science packages PyArrow, Polars, and DuckDB.

Previously, we have built all packages in our CI from within the repository. The
increasing number of packages with long build times have been a strain on our CI
resources. For instance, PyArrow takes tens of minutes to build. Now, several of
these packages are built in a separate repository and managed by the package
maintainers. In Pyodide 0.28.0,
[we are planning to unvendor the packages from the Pyodide runtime entirely](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/4918).
This will pave the way to supporting many more packages.

### Update to NumPy 2.0

We have updated NumPy to version 2.0.2. This is a major update that required
updates to many downstream packages in the scientific Python ecosystem. Please
see [Ecosystem compatibility with numpy 2.0](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/26191)
for information.

## Performance improvements to foreign function interface

We've long prioritized making the foreign function comprehensive and correct
over making it fast. At this point we no longer get many bug reports or feature
requests for the foreign function interface. However, for some use cases the
foreign function interface is inconvienently slow. We made several improvements.

The first improvement we made was to `getattr` on a `JsProxy`. Each `JsProxy`
has a Python dictionary in addition to the JavaScript object that it holds. When
someone accesses an attribute on the `JsProxy` we have to first look it up on
the dictionary. If we don't find the attribute on the dictionary, we then look
up the attribute on the JavaScript object. Most attributes are found in the
second lookup on the JavaScript object.  On this expected codepath, the failed
Python lookup raises an `AttributeError` which we catch. In a successful lookup,
between 43% and 76% of the execution time was spent formatting the message for
the `AttributeError`. We now avoid creating the `AttributeError` in the first place
which prevents wasting time formatting an error message that we will throw away.

The second improvement we made was to optimize away temporary bound methods.
To execute code like
```py
a.f()
```
Python first looks up `a.f` and then calls the result. This is translated into
bytecode like:
```
LOAD a
LOAD_ATTR f
CALL
```
The function `a.f` receives `a` as the first `self` argument, so it needs to be
a special bound method object that knows the correct value for the `self`
argument. However, we only use this object once to call it and then we throw it
away. We can avoid allocating and destroying an object when we call a method by
calling `type(a).f(a)`. The `LOAD_ATTR` opcode has a special argument that
indicates that the next opcode is going to be `CALL` and in that case calls a
method named `_PyObject_GetMethod` instead of the typical `PyObject_GetAttr` to
perform the attribute lookup. We patched `_PyObject_GetMethod` to have special
handling for `JsProxy` objects so that we could optimize away the temporary for
JS objects too.

It would be possible to also improve other opcode sequences like
```
LOAD a
LOAD_ATTR x
LOAD_ATTR y
```
but in typical Python code, `LOAD_ATTR` does need create a temporary so it would
require a more invasive patch to the Python interpreter.

## What's next?

We plan to upgrade to Python 3.13 in our next release. In addition, we
intend to make the following changes:

### Package unvendoring

We will unvendor the package recipes from the main Pyodide repository. The
package index will gain a separate release process from the Pyodide runtime
itself. This should have several significant benefits:

* It will reduce CI usage due to rebuilding packages less often.
* People who add a package will not have to wait as long until their package is
  included in our index.

### Upstream work in Emscripten and Python

We are working on
[restoring Emscripten to a tier 3 supported target for Python](https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/256).
As a part of this work, we are upstreaming
[a large number of fixes to the Emscripten file system](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127146).
For example, it now works to seek on `/dev/null` (it
does nothing), symlink support is much better, it will work to `stat` a file
descriptor which doesn't point to a named file, and many file system system
calls have more posix-compliant error handling. Most of these changes have not
made their way into Pyodide yet because we're still using Emscripten 3.1.58 for
ABI compatibility.

### Wasm Exception Handling

Emscripten supports two different stack unwinding ABIs for C++ exceptions, Rust
panics, and setjmp/longjmp, a legacy ABI based on JavaScript exception handling,
and a newer ABI based on WebAssembly Exception Handling. We use the JavaScript
Exception handling but hope to switch to WebAssembly exception handling. This
will lead to faster, smaller code, and fewer bugs. It also eliminates a lot of
complexity in the stack switching support code -- it is impossible to stack
switch through JavaScript frames and by default every C++ try block introduces a
JavaScript frame. This requires upstream work on the Rust compiler and switching
to a custom build of the Rust standard library.
