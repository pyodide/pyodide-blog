Pyodide v0.26.0 is out with Python 3.12. We made a lot of minor improvements to
the FFI and to the build system, and we made major improvements to stack
switching support. Most of the changes we made for this release are forward
looking, either nonfunctional work on maintenance, or functional work that is
still not exposed to the end user.

## Package build system

We made made major progress in unvendoring our package build system. This is
critical work because the current system of building 250+ packages on every
commit is not sustainable. ...

## JS API docs renderer Improvements

I did a major rewrite of part of `sphinx-js`, moving the logic for ingesting the
typedoc ast from Python to JavaScript. In the process of doing this I discovered
and fixed a large number of bugs. It is now dramatically easier to implement new
features and to update dependencies than it ever was before. I was able to fix
most of the remaining complaints I had about the rendering of Pyodide's JS API
docs. (The content itself still has a lot of issues though.)

## Improvements to Stack Switching Support

We fixed quite a few memory leaks involving stack switching, improved the
interactions with certain other language features, and polished the API.

We removed `pyodide.runPythonSyncifying` and just automatically turn on stack
switching when calling `runPythonAsync` or any `async` Python function. We also
renamed the method that switches stacks from `syncify` to `run_sync`.

Stack switching is ready for real-world use at this point. There are a lot of
usability improvements left to build. Chrome has started the 
[JSPI origin trial](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webassembly-jspi-origin-trial)
so if you want to use it in your web app you can add your domain to the origin trial.

## Memory snapshots

We implemented memory snapshots downstream to use with Cloudflare's Python
workers. We upstreamed part of this work. There is no stable API yet, and there
are a lot of features that do not work correctly yet. We know how to fix these
features, it just requires time. This should lead to a huge reduction in startup
time, particularly on page reloads when the memory snapshot is cached.

## Foreign function interface improvements

We started to address several long standing paper cuts involving conversion of
dictionaries in the foreign function interface. Now `toJs` of a dictionary
returns a `LiteralMap`. Any key which is a string and a valid JavaScript
identifier can be looked up by direct indexing `a.key`, in addition to being
able to look up the keys with `.get` as before. `Map` methods shadow keys
though, so if the JavaScript `Map` class gains more methods, it may cause minor
breakages.

For a similar purpose of adapting from Python JSON to JavaScript JSON without
doing a conversion we added `PyProxy.asJsJson()`. For example the following code
works now:
```js
const jsonStr1 = `{"a":[1,2,3,{"b":7}]}`;
const pyjsonmod = pyodide.pyimport("json");
const pyjson = pyjsonmod.loads(jsonStr1).asJsJson();
const jsonStr2 = JSON.stringify(pyjson);
console.log(jsonStr1 === jsonStr2); // true 
```
In future work, we intend to also add `JsProxy.as_py_json()` to do the reverse.

This still doesn't fix the case where someone does:
```
fetch("example.com", headers={"a": "b"});
```
