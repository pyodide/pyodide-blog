We are pleased to announce the Pyodide v0.28.0 release.

This release focused on several areas:
- X
- Y
- Z

## Build system and developer tooling improvements

- Enhancements added to `pyodide-build` as a part of this release cycle
  - Runtime search path support (in accordance with the Pyodide runtime)
- New features in `micropip`, and what it means for JupyterLite
- maybe a small section on `pyodide-pack`
- another section on `pyodide/auditwheel-emscripten`

### New packages, package updates, and unvendoring

In Pyodide 0.28.0, [we have unvendored the packages from the Pyodide runtime entirely](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/4918).
This will pave the way to supporting many more packages.

- Make note of switch to an external repository for adding recipes
- Mention nightly build environments for new packages, and how to use them
- Packages will now show up as soon as they are merged?
- Link to original RFC

### Pyodide runtime improvements

- More info on stack switching stuff?
- Emscripten 4.0.6
  - Advantages of using the latest Emscripten
  - Hood's work on Emscripten and subsequent maintainership
  - A few packages were disabled as a result â€“ we've tried to fix them but please help us out if you want them back!

### "PEP 776 - Emscripten Support" is now live

- Link PEP around CPython's commitment to tier III support
- Link Discourse thread
- Link other PRs

### A concrete definition for the Pyodide ABI

We are now at a position to define the Pyodide ABI and describe long-term stability
guarantees, which is important for the future of Pyodide and its underlying ecosystem.



- Mention use of custom Rust sysroot for exception handling
- `fwasm-exceptions` (also to be mentioned in build system improvements)
- Deviation from Emscripten and descriptions of long-standing patches
- See https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/5565 for more information

## Community spotlight: Pyodide in the wild

### SPy: statically typed Python

- New collaborative work on early-stage in-browser statically typed Python for graphics or computationally heavy use cases:
https://lukasz.langa.pl/f37aa97a-9ea3-4aeb-b6a0-9daeea5a7505/

### Interactive documentation via CZI grant to Scientific Python

- Wrapping up work on Pyodide interoperability and in-browser documentation for Scientific Python libraries via https://blog.scientific-python.org/scientific-python/2022-czi-grant/

## What's next?

### Improve `micropip` and ease the unvendoring of the recipes?

### Improving developer tooling
