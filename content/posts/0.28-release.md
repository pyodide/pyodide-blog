We are pleased to announce the Pyodide v0.28.0 release.

This release focused on standardizing the Pyodide platform for the long-term Python ecosystem.

## Introducing Pyodide ABI

CPython steering council has recently [approved restoring Emscripten as a tier III platform for CPython](https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/256), starting from Python 3.14.
As part of this effort, we are defining the Pyodide ABI within [PEP 783 â€“ Emscripten Packaging](https://peps.python.org/pep-0776/).
This PEP aims to standardize the binary interfaces that Pyodide packages should follow, helping ensure compatibility with current and future versions of Pyodide.

Each Pyodide ABI is tied to a specific Python and Emscripten version, not Pyodide version.
This means that packages built with a particular Pyodide ABI will be compatible across multiple Pyodide versions that share the same ABI.
We anticipate releasing a new Pyodide ABI with each major Python release, which occurs approximately every 12 months.

This is a crucial step towards integrating Pyodide more closely with PyPI and enabling the Pyodide ecosystem to develop with greater independence from Pyodide runtime releases.

### Building Packages with the Pyodide ABI

For package developers, building with Pyodide ABI compatibility is straightforward. Using `pyodide-build` or `cibuildwheel` will automatically produce ABI-compliant packages.
If you utilize custom build toolchains, such as `maturin` for Rust projects, please consult the [Pyodide ABI documentation](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/blob/main/docs/development/abi.md)
to ensure your packages meet the necessary compatibility standards.

## Decoupling packages from the Pyodide runtime

Pyodide is a Python distribution, which means it includes a set of pre-built packages that are deployed together with the Pyodide runtime.
In Pyodide's early stages, this approach was practical due to the challenges of getting packages to run in the browser, ensuring that all components were built and tested together.

However, as both the Pyodide and WebAssembly ecosystems have matured, this integrated approach has become less sustainable.

From a user perspective, accessing packages not included in the Pyodide distribution often meant waiting for the next Pyodide release, a process that could take several months.

From a maintainer perspective, every commit to the Pyodide runtime repository triggered a rebuild and retest of over 250 packages.
Even a minor code change could result in a Continuous Integration (CI) run exceeding four hours.

In this release, we've taken a significant step by unvendoring packages from the Pyodide runtime repository.

All packages are now built in a separate repository, [pyodide/pyodide-recipes](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-recipes).
The main Pyodide runtime repository now contains only the core packages essential for the runtime's operation.
This modification will enable us to release sets of packages separately and more frequently, independent of the Pyodide runtime's release schedule.

While we continue to build most packages internally, we are progressing towards a model where package maintainers can build and publish their own packages directly to PyPI or other package indexes.

## Python 3.13 support and disabled packages

Pyodide 0.28.0 is based on Python 3.13 and Emscripten 4.0.9 Unfortunately, some of the packages that were previously included in Pyodide 0.27 was temporarily disabled due to incompatibilities.

The list of packages that were disabled in this release is as follows:

- arro3-io
- arro3-compute
- arro3-core
- polars
- pyarrow
- osqp
- duckdb
- gensim
- zarr
- pygame-ce
- pyproj
- geopandas
- cartopy

These packages will be re-enabled when we can resolve the issues with them, and we welcome contributions from the community to help us with this.

## New matplotlib backend for Pyodide

For years, Pyodide relied on a custom Matplotlib backend (`wasm_backend`) to render plots directly in your browser.
This backend was developed by the creator of Pyodide, Michael Droettboom, who was also a core developer of matplotlib.

However, it hadn't been maintained for a long time, and without dedicated expertise among our core developers,
it became increasingly incompatible with newer Matplotlib versions. This made it tough to keep up with new features and critical bug fixes.

We're thrilled to announce that in this release, we've deprecated our custom backend and replaced it with a patched version of the official webagg backend.
This new backend delivers a much more stable and feature-rich experience for all your Matplotlib plotting needs in the browser.

In this release, we are happy to announce that we have deprecated these custom backend, and replaced it with the new patched version of the `webagg` backend,
which is one of the official matplotlib backends. This new backend provides a more stable and feature-rich experience for rendering matplotlib plots in the browser.

A huge thank you to [Ian Thomas](https://github.com/ianthomas23), a core Matplotlib developer and JupyterLite maintainer, who is now maintaining this new backend.

## Other improvements

### Standardized Package Loading with Runtime Paths

We've been working closely with the Emscripten team to significantly improve how shared libraries are loaded in Pyodide.
This release introduces support for runtime paths in Emscripten modules, which allows us to correctly locate shared library dependencies.

Historically, this was a hurdle for standardizing package loading process in overall Python-in-the-browser ecosystem.
Users had to rely on undocumented Pyodide-specific behavior for package loading because Emscripten's dynamic loading didn't include runtime path support,
which is a common feature in native environments like Linux and Windows.

This change ensures that packages built with the Pyodide ABI will be compatible with other Emscripten-based projects,
fostering growth for the entire Python-in-the-browser ecosystem.

### Increased Adoption of JSPI

JSPI (JavaScript Promise Integration) officially became a Stage 4 finished proposal on April 8, 2025, and Chrome 137 (released May 27, 2025) now supports JSPI by default, no experimental flag needed.

Pyodide has been a long-time experimenter with JSPI, and we're excited to include some key JSPI features by default in this release.
This means you can now use `asyncio.run` and `loop.run_until_complete` in Pyodide to execute Python code in the browser to wait for asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread.

Previously, this capability was hidden behind the `enableRunUntilComplete` flag in `loadPyodide`.
Now, if your browser supports JSPI, these features are enabled automatically for a smoother, more responsive experience.
