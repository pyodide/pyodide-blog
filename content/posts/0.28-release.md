We are pleased to announce the Pyodide v0.28.0 release.

This release focused on standardizing the Pyodide platform for the long-term Python ecosystem.

## Introducing Pyodide ABI

CPython steering council has recently [approved restoring Emscripten as a tier III platform for CPython](https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/256), starting from Python 3.14.
As part of this effort, we are on a process of defining the Pyodide ABI (Application Binary Interface) in [PEP 783 – Emscripten Packaging](https://peps.python.org/pep-0776/), to standardize
the interfaces that Pyodide packages should use to ensure compatibility with current and future versions of Pyodide.

Each Pyodide ABI is tied to a specific Python and Emscripten version, not Pyodide version.
It means that packages built with a specific Pyodide ABI can run on several Pyodide versions that share the same ABI.
We are planning to release a new Pyodide ABI per major Python release, which is approximately every 12 months.

This is a step towards making Pyodide a first-class citizen in PyPI, and to enable the Pyodide ecosystem to grow independently of the Pyodide runtime releases.

### Using Pyodide ABI to build packages

Building packages using `pyodide build` or `cibuildwheel` will automatically produce packages that are compatible with the Pyodide ABI.
If you are using custom build toolchain such as `maturin` in rust projects, please follow the [Pyodide ABI documentation](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/blob/main/docs/development/abi.md)
to ensure that your packages are compatible with the Pyodide ABI.

## Decoupling packages from the Pyodide runtime

Pyodide is a Python distribution, which means it includes a set of pre-built packages that are deployed together with the Pyodide runtime.
In the early days of Pyodide, getting packages to run in the Pyodide environment was a huge challenge, therefore we decided to build and test all the packages together with the Pyodide runtime.

However, as the Pyodide ecosystem grew, and the WebAssembly ecosystem matured, we realized that this approach is not sustainable in the long term.

In user perspective, it was difficult to use packages that are not included in the Pyodide distribution.
Most of the time, users would need to wait until the next Pyodide release to use new packages, which could take several months.

In maintainer perspective, all the packages included in the Pyodide distribution was rebuilt and tested together whenever a new commit was made to the Pyodide runtime.
A single line of code change in the Pyodide would build more than 250 packages, and took more than 4 hours for the CI to finish.

In this release, we made a small but significant step towards decoupling the packages from the Pyodide runtime.
We have unvendored the packages from the Pyodide runtime repository, which means that the packages are no longer built and tested together with the Pyodide runtime.
All the packages are now built in a separate repository [pyodide/pyodide-recipes](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-recipes),
and the Pyodide runtime repository only contains the core packages that are essential for the Pyodide runtime to work.
This change will allow us to release a set of packages separately and more frequently, without waiting for the next Pyodide release.

We are still building most of the packages by ourselves, but we are moving towards a model where package maintainers can build their own packages and publish them to PyPI or other package indexes.

## Python 3.13 support and disabled packages

Pyodide 0.28.0 is based on Python 3.13 and Emscripten 4.0.9 Unfortunately, some of the packages that were previously included in Pyodide 0.27 was temporarily disabled due to incompatibilities.

The list of packages that were disabled in this release is as follows:

- arro3-io
- arro3-compute
- arro3-core
- polars
- pyarrow
- osqp
- duckdb
- gensim
- zarr
- pygame-ce
- pyproj
- geopandas
- cartopy

These packages will be re-enabled when we can resolve the issues with them, and we welcome contributions from the community to help us with this.

## Build system and developer tooling improvements

- Enhancements added to `pyodide-build` as a part of this release cycle
  - Runtime search path support (in accordance with the Pyodide runtime)
- New features in `micropip`, and what it means for JupyterLite
- maybe a small section on `pyodide-pack`
- another section on `pyodide/auditwheel-emscripten`

### Pyodide runtime improvements

- More info on stack switching stuff?
- Emscripten 4.0.6
  - Advantages of using the latest Emscripten
  - Hood's work on Emscripten and subsequent maintainership
  - A few packages were disabled as a result – we've tried to fix them but please help us out if you want them back!

## Community spotlight: Pyodide in the wild

### SPy: statically typed Python

- New collaborative work on early-stage in-browser statically typed Python for graphics or computationally heavy use cases:
https://lukasz.langa.pl/f37aa97a-9ea3-4aeb-b6a0-9daeea5a7505/

### Interactive documentation via CZI grant to Scientific Python

- Wrapping up work on Pyodide interoperability and in-browser documentation for Scientific Python libraries via https://blog.scientific-python.org/scientific-python/2022-czi-grant/

## What's next?

### Improve `micropip` and ease the unvendoring of the recipes?

### Improving developer tooling
